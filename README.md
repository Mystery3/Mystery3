## Who am I?

Hi I'm Mystery, or Flaps9562 on Discord. I'm currently a university student studying computer science. So far I've worked on several GUI applications relating to a game, Realm of the Mad God. All of these were in Python, which I've become quite familiar with, but I'm looking to learn Rust and C++ next. Additionally, I've started learning web development in HTML/CSS/JS. In my free time, I also enjoy playing badminton.
